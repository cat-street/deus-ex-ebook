          The golden age of local toy production came to an end with the death
          of Yvonne Koníčky in September 2022. She
          was the last of a great line of Koníčky children who instinctively
          knew how to strike a perfect balance
          between innocence and innovation. Propeller Frog Boy - voted toy of
          the year in 1998 - is a particularly
          memorable example.
        </p>
        <p class="article__text">
          Today the Koníčky and Hračky toy factory lies in tragic disrepair, a
          constant reminder of the childish
          innocence our city has lost. Owned by Drahomír Koníčky, Yvonne's son
          and business heir, the factory has become
          a hotspot for criminal activity. Drahomir is rumored to have spent his
          life (and his fortune) cultivating
          corrupt police and gang contacts throughout the country. In his few
          years at the head of the family business,
          he's managed to dry up the family funds, debase the family name, and
          turn a beloved childhood landmark into
          one of the most dangerous corners of Prague.
        </p>
        <p class="article__text">
          I remember walking up to the factory as a little girl and being turned
          away by a guard at the gate. We can't
          give away the wonderful secrets inside, he said. I don't know what
          kind of response a little girl walking up
          to Koníčky and Hračky might get today. Ideally, she won't get any
          response at all, because her parents will
          have told her to stay away.
